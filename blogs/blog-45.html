Field teams iterate faster when they share play by play recaps instead of sanitized recaps. Therapists, HR leads, and sports scientists align on one idea: mental wellness improves when sleep becomes predictable. Communities of practice trade field reports to shortcut learning curves across regions. The playbook blends technology with timeless habits so rest becomes a company wide advantage. Capture real world lessons weekly and circulate them so improvements compound. Better sleep is the quiet infrastructure for resilient teams.

      <p>Electric vehicles shifted from halo products to mainstream offerings across every price band. We spent time with operators in the field to document the gritty realities behind the trend.</p>
      <p>Battery innovation, software centric dashboards, and charging standards rewrite what it means to build a car. The stories highlight constraints around budgets, compliance, and human change management.</p>
      <h2>Momentum Reshaping the Landscape</h2>
      <p>Legacy automakers spin up EV only factories while startups pursue vertical integration.</p>
      <p>Field teams iterate faster when they share play by play recaps instead of sanitized recaps.</p>
      <h3>Shifts to watch</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gigafactories colocated with renewable power</li>
        <li>Software updates unlocking new driving modes</li>
        <li>Battery recycling programs closing the loop</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Signals From the Field</h2>
      <p>Charging networks, grid partnerships, and subscription services show how transportation becomes an energy platform.</p>
      <p>Communities of practice trade field reports to shortcut learning curves across regions.</p>
      <h3>Signals worth tracking</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Retailers installing fast chargers</li>
        <li>Utilities coinvesting in depot charging</li>
        <li>Ride hailing fleets announcing EV only pledges</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Playbook Moves to Try</h2>
      <p>Delightful EV ownership requires orchestrating hardware, software, and service touchpoints.</p>
      <p>Capture real world lessons weekly and circulate them so improvements compound.</p>
      <h3>Action items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan charging coverage before launching models</li>
        <li>Partner with cities on curbside infrastructure</li>
        <li>Upskill technicians on high voltage safety</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The auto industry now competes on electrons and experiences, not horsepower. Close each project with a field retro so future crews start on third base.</p>

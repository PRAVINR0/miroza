      <p>Electric vehicles shifted from halo products to mainstream offerings across every price band. Executives asked for the leadership view, so we focus on governance, incentives, and decision rights.</p>
      <p>Battery innovation, software centric dashboards, and charging standards rewrite what it means to build a car. This lens explains how to brief boards, align budgets, and communicate progress without drowning people in jargon.</p>
      <h2>Momentum Reshaping the Landscape</h2>
      <p>Legacy automakers spin up EV only factories while startups pursue vertical integration.</p>
      <p>Leadership teams that codify intent early are shipping roadmaps faster because they remove political drag.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Gigafactories colocated with renewable power</li>
        <li>Software updates unlocking new driving modes</li>
        <li>Battery recycling programs closing the loop</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Signals From the Field</h2>
      <p>Charging networks, grid partnerships, and subscription services show how transportation becomes an energy platform.</p>

        <li>Ride hailing fleets announcing EV only pledges</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Playbook Moves to Try</h2>
      <p>Delightful EV ownership requires orchestrating hardware, software, and service touchpoints.</p>
      <p>Translate the narrative into leadership friendly OKRs so accountability lives beyond one team.</p>
      <h3>Action items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan charging coverage before launching models</li>

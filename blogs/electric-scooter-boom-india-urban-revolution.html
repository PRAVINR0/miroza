      </figure>

      <p>Across Indian cities, a quiet revolution is underway. Electric scooters—once a niche product—have become a mainstream choice for commuters, delivery workers, and small entrepreneurs. Growth has been driven by economics, policy incentives, improved batteries, and a cultural shift toward more sustainable urban mobility. By 2025, the EV two-wheeler market has evolved into a complex ecosystem: manufacturers, battery-as-a-service providers, municipal planners and app platforms are all jockeying to shape the next phase.</p>

      <h2>Economics and affordability</h2>
      <p>One of the decisive factors behind the boom is running cost. Compared with petrol two-wheelers, electric scooters offer dramatically lower per-kilometre costs because electricity is cheaper per unit of travel and fewer moving parts reduce maintenance. For many riders, total cost of ownership becomes competitive within a couple of years, especially when charging at home or using public fast-charging networks. Finance options and manufacturer subsidies have also lowered the upfront barrier for middle-income buyers.</p>

      <h2>Technology improvements</h2>
      <p>Battery technology and management systems improved rapidly over the past few years. Better cell chemistry, smarter battery-management systems, and modular designs have extended range and lifespan. Many models now feature regenerative braking, telematics for remote diagnostics, and app-based controls for geofencing and anti-theft. Rapid charging hubs have appeared in dense neighbourhoods, enabling gig-economy riders to top up between runs.</p>

      <h2>Policy and infrastructure</h2>
      <p>Government incentives—both at central and state levels—have been pivotal. Subsidies for manufacturers, incentives for first-time buyers, and proposals for dedicated EV lanes in congested corridors make the business case stronger. Local authorities are also partnering with private providers to roll out public charging infrastructure, while some cities are experimenting with battery-swap stations that reduce downtime for commercial riders.</p>

      <h2>Impact on livelihoods</h2>
      <p>For delivery riders, the shift is often immediate and practical: longer daily ranges, lower fuel costs, and reduced maintenance mean higher take-home pay. Small businesses that rely on quick point-to-point deliveries (food, groceries, parcels) find electric two-wheelers easier to operate at scale. The environmental benefit—reduced tailpipe emissions—also aligns with urban air-quality goals.</p>

      <h2>Challenges and gaps</h2>
      <p>Despite successes, several issues remain. Charging infrastructure is uneven, particularly in peri-urban areas and apartment complexes where centralized charging is harder. Battery degradation and second-life management present logistical and regulatory challenges. The industry must also manage end-of-life recycling for batteries, which requires collection networks and facilities that are still being established.</p>

      <p>Other barriers include concerns about safety at higher speeds, licensing and regulation harmonization, and the need for skilled technicians to service modern EV systems. Addressing these gaps will require coordinated policy action and private investment.</p>

      <h2>Social and urban implications</h2>
      <p>The scooter boom changes city dynamics. Smaller parking footprints, reduced noise, and cheaper mobility expand access to jobs and services. Greater adoption by women riders in some cities signals social shifts in mobility access. At the same time, cities must plan for mixed traffic that includes both pedal-powered, battery-powered and conventional vehicles.</p>

        <figcaption>App integrations and fleet management tools make electric scooters a practical option for businesses.</figcaption>

      <h2>Where next?</h2>
      <p>Industry forecasts suggest India could be the world's largest market for EV two-wheelers by 2030 if current trends continue. Further declines in battery costs, expanded charging infrastructure, and tighter emissions standards for internal combustion engines would accelerate the shift. The winners will be companies that combine reliable hardware, strong service networks, and integrated digital platforms for fleet and battery management.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The electric scooter boom is more than a product trend; it is a systemic shift in urban mobility. It touches economics, technology, urban planning and livelihoods. If cities, companies and policymakers collaborate to close the infrastructure and regulatory gaps, e-scooters can deliver cleaner, cheaper and more inclusive mobility for millions of people.</p>

Not every team has a lab full of experts, so this starter guide explains the minimum viable moves. Wearables, clinical grade coaching, and policy experiments give people actionable feedback on sleep debt. It highlights the first ninety days, the roles involved, and the red flags to avoid. Health teams blend CBT techniques with environmental tweaks so rest metrics improve without obsession. Starter teams that constrain scope build confidence because they celebrate early wins before scaling. Therapists, HR leads, and sports scientists align on one idea: mental wellness improves when sleep becomes predictable. Playful internal branding plus clear onboarding paths pull newcomers into the work quickly. The playbook blends technology with timeless habits so rest becomes a company wide advantage. Outline the smallest viable project, pair it with a mentor, and schedule reflection windows. Better sleep is the quiet infrastructure for resilient teams. Treat the guide as a checklist you can reuse for every new cohort."

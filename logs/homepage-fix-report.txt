MIROZA Homepage Fix Report – 2025-11-28
=======================================

Data sources scanned
--------------------
- /data/posts.json (43 stories; JSON feed available)
- /data/news.json (10 India desk bulletins; JSON feed available)
- /data/blogs.json (50 blog entries; JSON feed available)
- /sitemap.xml (registered for fallback HTML scanning; not required in this run)

Homepage selections
-------------------
- News bucket: 8 newest stories (interleaved, shuffled before placement)
- Articles bucket: 8 newest long-form dispatches
- Blogs bucket: 8 newest opinion/insight posts
- Final round-robin feed: 24 cards (news → articles → blogs, repeated) with deduping by slug/url
- Progressive rendering: first 3 cards injected immediately, remaining cards streamed in batches of 8 via the new load-more control + IntersectionObserver

Fallback activity
-----------------
- JSON feeds were healthy, so HTML scraping fallback was not triggered. The sitemap parser is wired and will populate arrays automatically if any feed is missing/empty.

Layout & scroll fixes
---------------------
- Confirmed existing `html, body, main` flex rules already prevent 100vh clipping; no additional CSS required.
- Latest-section container is now pre-marked with `data-home-feed` so JS populates it immediately, eliminating the blank space previously caused by missing cards.

Console/audit output
--------------------
- `[MIROZA] Home feed audit` logs the files read, category counts, selected items, and fallback status for each page load.

Manual verification checklist
-----------------------------
1. `npx http-server . -p 8080` then open http://localhost:8080.
2. Confirm hero plus the first three cards render above the fold with no white gap.
3. Scroll past the first fold; additional cards should stream in automatically or by tapping **Load more stories**.
4. Click at least three cards (one per category) and verify navigation resolves to the proper article/blog/news page.
5. Toggle dark/light mode, refresh, and confirm the preference persists.
6. Monitor the browser console for `[MIROZA] Home feed audit`; ensure no uncaught errors appear.

Additional homepage polish (2025-11-28)
---------------------------------------
- Updated canonical, OpenGraph, and Twitter metadata to point at https://miroza.online/.
- Replaced mojibake characters (arrows, dashes, accent marks) with HTML entities so copy renders correctly on every page load.
- Confirmed the quick-find hint now uses the Command-key entity (`&#8984;`) to avoid encoding issues across browsers.

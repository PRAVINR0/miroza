        <h2>Full coverage</h2>
        <p>Canada and India have agreed to resume trade talks that had been paused amid diplomatic friction. The decision to restart negotiations follows a sequence of high-level discussions focused on rebuilding trust and addressing trade irritants. Officials framed the restart as an opportunity to expand market access, address tariff and non-tariff barriers, and explore cooperation in technology and services.</p>

        <p>Negotiation priorities: Both sides are expected to focus on agricultural market access, rules of origin for key goods, and services mobility. Canada has highlighted concerns such as tariff lines affecting pulses and agri-products, while India seeks stronger frameworks for information technology services and skilled mobility.</p>

        <p>Geopolitical context: Reviving talks is also a diplomatic signal — improving bilateral ties can open avenues for cooperation on supply chains, critical minerals, and clean-energy partnerships. Negotiators will likely proceed in staged rounds with technical teams scoping deliverables before political leaders set timelines.</p>

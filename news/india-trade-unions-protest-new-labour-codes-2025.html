    <p>Ten major Indian trade unions announced nationwide protests starting this week, condemning recently passed labour codes that they claim dilute worker protections and increase job insecurity. Demonstrations have already begun in multiple states, including Odisha, West Bengal, and Chhattisgarh.</p>
    <p>The unions argue that the new regulations make hiring and firing easier for employers, extending factory shifts, and raise thresholds for mandatory layoffs — measures they say favour corporates over workers. Small and medium enterprises have also voiced concerns about compliance complexities and potential unrest.</p>
    <p>The central government defended the reforms as necessary to modernize labour laws and attract investment, but opposition parties and labour activists warned of prolonged unrest and urged negotiations before full implementation.</p>

    <p>India’s economy posted a strong 8.2% year-on-year growth in the July–September quarter of 2025, marking one of the fastest quarterly growth rates in recent years. Strong consumer demand, robust export front-loading ahead of global tariff pressures, and stimulus-driven infrastructure spending contributed significantly to the growth.</p>
    <p>Manufacturing and construction sectors reported notable gains of 9.1% and 7.2% respectively, while private consumption rose by 7.9%. Analysts noted that despite global headwinds and trade tensions, domestic demand and policy support helped sustain momentum.</p>
    <p>Economic experts believe that if structural reforms continue and external pressures ease, India could maintain 6–7% growth through FY26. However, risks remain: inflation control, global trade uncertainties, and credit flow to SMEs will be key to watch.</p>

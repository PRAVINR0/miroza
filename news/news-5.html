        <h2>Full coverage</h2>
        <p>Official data released today shows India’s GDP accelerated to its strongest pace in 18 months, driven by manufacturing, exports, and consumer demand. The improvement in growth metrics comes as policy measures aimed at investment and infrastructure begin to register in economic activity statistics.</p>

        <p>Sectoral performance: Manufacturing output grew notably, supported by improved export orders and domestic demand. Services also showed resilience, particularly in transport and digital services, while agriculture registered steady readings after a favorable monsoon season in key growing regions.</p>

        <p>Policy interpretation: Economists highlight that while the uptick is encouraging, sustaining higher growth will depend on continued investment, credit availability, and global trade conditions. The ruling government has touted the numbers as validation of its economic strategy, which could influence political narratives ahead of national campaigns.</p>

        <h3>Why it matters</h3>
        <p>Economic performance directly impacts voter sentiment and political narratives.</p>

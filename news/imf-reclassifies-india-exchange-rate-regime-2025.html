    <p>The IMF has reclassified India’s currency management framework from a “stabilised” regime to a “crawl-like” arrangement after sustained rupee volatility in recent months. The decision reflects changing dynamics in global capital flows and foreign-exchange interventions.</p>
    <p>Policy analysts said this shift might influence foreign investment, currency hedging costs, and import-export pricing structures. While the Reserve Bank of India has defended its market interventions, the reclassification has prompted caution among exporters and import-dependent industries.</p>
    <p>Some economists view this as a short-term realignment, expecting gradual stabilization if global interest rates ease, but recommend firms hedge forex exposure and monitor capital flow developments closely.</p>

    <p>An airplane arriving from Kabul landed on an incorrect runway at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport late Sunday, prompting immediate grounding of flights and security protocols. Officials have launched an inquiry into air-traffic control procedures and pilot coordination. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</p>
    <p>Authorities confirmed that the aircraft landed without casualties, but described the incident as a “serious safety lapse.” Flights were diverted and passengers deplaned safely under supervision. Aviation regulators said the cockpit voice recorders and ATC logs will be reviewed.</p>
    <p>Policy analysts called for urgent upgrades in runway signage, pilot training and ATC-infrastructure to prevent repeat incidents. Passenger safety groups demanded transparency in findings and corrective action before resuming normal operations.</p>

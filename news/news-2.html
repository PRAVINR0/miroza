        <h2>Full coverage</h2>
        <p>Trade unions across the country organized large-scale demonstrations in response to the recent implementation of new labour codes, asserting that the legislative changes dilute essential worker protections. The protests — which drew thousands in major cities and regional centers — were accompanied by calls for negotiations, legal challenges, and a re-examination of the codes' provisions.</p>

        <p>What unions say: Union leaders argue that key protections around contract work, dispute resolution, and collective bargaining have been weakened. They describe the rollout as rushed and have issued demands ranging from amendments to immediate consultations with worker representatives to the temporary suspension of certain provisions.</p>

        <p>Government response: Officials maintain that the codes modernize labour law, simplify compliance for employers, and aim to boost employment. The government has offered meetings with union representatives but has ruled out reversing the core framework, saying changes are necessary to align labour regulation with contemporary economic realities.</p>

        <p>Economic and social consequences: Analysts warn that lengthy protests could disrupt production and supply chains in localized regions, affecting small and medium enterprises in particular. There is an added political dimension as parties and civil society groups weigh in, making this a potential flashpoint in the months ahead.</p>

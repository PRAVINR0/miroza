        <h2>Full coverage</h2>
        <p>Recent opinion polling across key Hindi-heartland states suggests that the ruling alliance led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to maintain a commanding lead. Poll aggregators and local survey houses report a pattern of steady support, with the coalition benefiting from a combination of incumbency, organizational strength, and consolidated regional alliances.</p>

        <p>Poll breakdown: Across several states, the coalition shows comfortable leads in rural and semi-urban areas, while urban constituencies present a mixed picture. The polls point to effective vote consolidation around the alliance in regions where local partners have strong ground connect.</p>

        <p>Opposition response: Opposition parties contest the projections, citing sampling limitations and warning of complacency. They underline that election dynamics can shift rapidly, especially in response to local issues and campaign messaging.</p>

        <p>Significance: If the projections hold, the alliance's strong showing in Hindi-speaking states would underscore the coalition's continuing electoral appeal and complicate opponents' strategies, forcing a recalibration ahead of national contests.</p>

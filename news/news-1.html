        <h2>Full coverage</h2>
        <p>The 2025 Bihar Legislative Assembly election produced an emphatic result as the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 202 of the 243 seats, delivering a clear and commanding mandate. Voter turnout remained robust across the state, and the result consolidated the incumbent coalition’s political position in Bihar. This piece unpacks the seat distribution, key battleground districts, post-election reactions, and the likely policy and political consequences at both state and national levels.</p>

        <p>Background: Bihar has long been a politically contested state, with regional parties holding significant sway. The NDA’s performance this cycle reflects strong local campaigning, alliance management, and the resonance of development and welfare narratives in rural and semi-urban constituencies. Several opposition groupings fell short in key districts where the NDA managed to convert marginal seats into wins.</p>

        <p>Seat distribution and trends: Of the 243 seats, the NDA’s tally of 202 means the alliance exceeded expectations in dozens of constituencies. Analysts point to superior grassroots organization, targeted welfare announcements in the months before polling, and effective turnouts in rural areas. Urban centers displayed a more mixed picture, but the margin of NDA victories in rural districts proved decisive.</p>

        <p>Reactions: Ruling leaders celebrated the result as an endorsement of their policy agenda. Opposition figures acknowledged the outcome and pointed to factors such as alliance fragmentation and messaging failures. Independent observers emphasized the role of state-level alliances and on-the-ground mobilization in shaping the outcome.</p>

        <p>Implications: The verdict reshapes state politics and influences the national political balance. A decisive win in Bihar strengthens the NDA’s negotiating position with regional partners and provides momentum ahead of upcoming national contests. Policy-wise, the result is likely to embolden the state government to proceed with its current agenda, while the opposition will need to regroup and re-strategize.</p>

        <h3>Why it matters</h3>
        <p>The verdict reshapes state politics and influences national political balance, marking a significant mandate for the ruling coalition. Bihar is a large, politically consequential state whose electoral signals often inform broader national narratives.</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>Good for a detailed post-election analysis article with background, seat distribution, reactions, and implications.</p>

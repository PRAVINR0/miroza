    <p>Spot gold prices in Indian markets rose nearly 1%, reaching a two-week high amid growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve may cut interest rates soon. The rate outlook triggered demand for bullion as a hedge against currency volatility and global market uncertainty. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>
    <p>Local jewellers and retail investors rushed to purchase gold, pushing demand up. Analysts believe demand may remain strong if global geopolitical risks persist. However, further gains could be capped by import duties and local price controls.</p>
    <p>For households and small investors, this rise re-emphasizes gold's traditional role as a safe-haven — especially amidst inflation and currency pressure. Experts suggest keeping moderate exposure and diversifying investments.</p>

    <p>Meteorological Department has issued a red-alert for several coastal districts as a powerful cyclone approaches the Bay of Bengal. Authorities ordered mass evacuation in vulnerable low-lying areas and deployed National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams for rescue readiness.</p>
    <p>State governments instructed residents to move to safer shelters and stay indoors. Fishermen were advised against venturing into open seas until further notice. The cyclone is likely to make landfall within 48 hours, with heavy rainfall, strong winds, and possible storm surges expected.</p>
    <p>Experts urged preventive measures and urged citizens to monitor official advisories. Farmers and coastal communities were advised to protect livestock and property ahead of the storm.</p>

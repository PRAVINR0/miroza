    <p>Officials from India and the United States confirmed that trade negotiations, stalled since last year, have entered the final stage. Key issues under discussion include tariff reductions, digital-trade safeguards, and mutual tariff waivers on select commodities. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p>
    <p>If successful, the agreement could boost Indiaâ€™s export competitiveness, particularly in textiles, agriculture, and IT services. Industry bodies have expressed cautious optimism, noting that tariff clarity may attract foreign investment and increase cross-border supply-chain integration.</p>
    <p>However, some stakeholders warned that easing tariffs might expose domestic farmers and manufacturers to external competition. Economists recommend phased implementation with protective measures for vulnerable sectors.</p>

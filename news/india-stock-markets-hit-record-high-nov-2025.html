    <p>Major Indian stock indexes surged to all-time highs today, as investors reacted positively to improved earnings forecasts and easing global valuations. Market optimism was boosted by strong quarterly results from key sectors such as IT, banking, and consumer goods.</p>
    <p>Analysts attributed the rally to improved macroeconomic sentiment after GDP data and rate-cut expectations by the central bank. Foreign institutional investors also returned, contributing net inflows for the second straight week.</p>
    <p>Observers cautioned that volatility may persist given global uncertainty, but said domestic growth prospects and reforms could sustain bullish momentum into early 2026.</p>

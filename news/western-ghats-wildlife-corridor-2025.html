    <p>The Government of India has officially declared a 1,200-square-kilometre zone in the Western Ghats as a protected wildlife corridor. The move aims to secure migratory paths for elephants and preserve the region's rich biodiversity against increasing developmental pressure.</p>
    <p>Environmentalists hailed the initiative, citing reduction in human-animal conflict and enhanced habitat protection. The corridor spans multiple states and involves new regulations on land use, deforestation, and development activities. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>
    <p>Officials promised to implement monitoring systems, forest patrols, and community-based conservation programs. Local communities will be engaged for sustainable livelihood options to ensure ecological and human welfare go hand in hand.</p>

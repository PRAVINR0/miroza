Miroza — Static Website

Overview:
- This repository is a static website named "Miroza" that aggregates content: Daily News, Blogs, Articles, Stories, and Informational pages.

Files and purpose:
- `index.html` — Home page. Loads recent items from each content type, mixes them in a shuffled layout and displays clickable cards linking to `detail.html`.
- `articles.html`, `blog.html`, `news.html`, `stories.html`, `info.html` — List pages for each content type. Each page fetches `assets/data/<type>.json` and renders the content grid. Cards link to `detail.html?type=<type>&id=<id>`.
- `detail.html` — A single detail page used by all content types. It reads the URL query parameters `type` and `id`, loads the correct JSON file, finds the item by `id`, and renders title, large image, date, category, and full `content`.
- `assets/css/style.css` — Central stylesheet. Defines color variables for light and dark themes, responsive grid layout, glass-morphism cards, and animations.
- `assets/js/main.js` — Site-wide JavaScript. Responsibilities:
  - `injectHeader()` inserts a common header and footer into every page and sets the copyright year.
  - `initTheme()` initializes theme from `localStorage` or system preference.
  - `initMenus()` wires the 3-dot (more) menu and theme toggle.
  - `fetchJSON(path)` fetches JSON files.
  - `renderCards(container, items, large=false, typeOverride)` renders clickable content cards into a grid container; cards link to `detail.html?type=...&id=...`.
  - `shuffleArray(array)` shuffles arrays (used on the homepage).
  - `getQueryParams()` parses URL query parameters.
  - `loadDetail()` loads and renders the detail view on `detail.html`.

JSON data format:
- `assets/data/*.json` — Each file is a JSON array of objects. Each object must include the fields below (example):
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Example Title",
    "description": "Short summary.",
    "content": "Long detailed content for the detail page.",
    "date": "2025-01-01",
    "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-example",
    "category": "General"
  }

Important notes about JSON:
- `id` must be a unique number for each item in its file. Links to details use this `id`.
- The `type` used in URLs matches the JSON filename (e.g., `type=articles` maps to `assets/data/articles.json`).

How pages are connected:
- Every HTML page includes `assets/js/main.js`. `injectHeader()` writes the header (and footer) into the page, keeping navigation consistent.
- `renderCards()` wraps each card in an anchor to `detail.html?type=<type>&id=<id>`. Clicking a card loads the detail page with the correct query parameters.

Detail page behavior:
- `detail.html` calls `loadDetail()` which:
  1. Reads `type` and `id` from the URL query string.
  2. Loads `assets/data/<type>.json`.
  3. Finds the item where numeric `id` matches.
  4. Renders title, a large hero image, date, category and the full `content` text.
  5. Shows a back link (“← Back to {pageType}”) that points back to the type's list page.

How to add new content:
1. Open `assets/data/<type>.json` (e.g., `assets/data/articles.json`).
2. Add a new object with a unique numeric `id` and the fields shown above.
3. Save and open the site — the client-side JS will load and display the new item automatically.

Theme (Dark / Light Mode):
- Theme is persisted in `localStorage` under the key `miroza-theme` with values `dark` or `light`.
- `initTheme()` applies the saved theme or uses the system `prefers-color-scheme` if no saved preference exists.

Footer and copyright:
- The footer is injected by `injectHeader()` and includes the copyright line:
  `© Miroza <span id="year"></span>. All Rights Reserved.`
- The script sets `document.getElementById('year').textContent = new Date().getFullYear()` automatically.

Hosting with GitHub Pages:
- This is a purely static site and can be hosted via GitHub Pages. Publish the repository and enable Pages (from `main` or `gh-pages`). Because navigation uses plain links and query parameters, no server-side routing is required.
- If a custom domain is used, ensure the `CNAME` file is correct and DNS is configured by the site owner.

Developer notes & next steps:
- All UI is written in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for portability and ease of hosting.
- If you'd like, I can add:
  - A GitHub Actions workflow to run basic link checks on push.
  - Search, filtering, or pagination features for long lists.
  - Per-item dedicated HTML pages (instead of `detail.html`) if you prefer static pre-rendered pages.
